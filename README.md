# Singapore-Flat-Price-Prediction

View the [demo](http://34.87.108.41/) here

This is a repository to show people how they could create a flat price predictor by using some past data. For more details, you can
read from this [medium post](https://medium.com/@edricgan.44/6f74ed8da311). You can understand the process of creating a predictor
from `SG_Flat_Price_Prediction_Publish_Medium.ipynb`.

Besides that, I have also created a webpage as a demo. I have published the code under `server` and `front_end`. Please refer to
them if you find them useful.
