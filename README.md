# Singapore-Flat-Price-Prediction

View the [demo](http://34.87.108.41/) here

This is a repository to show people how they could create a flat price predictor by using some past data.

Besides that, I have also created a webpage as a demo. I have published the code under `server` and `front_end`. Please refer to
them if you find them useful.
